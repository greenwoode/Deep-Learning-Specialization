# Deep-Learning Specialization

## Accelerating Image Classification Models with Input Domain Restrictions

We aim to show that domain-restricted models can learn more valuable information during training, and subsequently out perform a general model at a given size. We trained two models, one on an ImageNet subset, and another on a custom dataset comprised of frames from video games. This repository is comprised of the code utlized in its [accompanying thesis](https://library.wit.edu/home). 

## thesis not yet published, please email me at ethan.a.greenwood@gmail.com for a copy at this time.

This repository has two branches, one for the [data collecting](https://github.com/greenwoode/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/Data) and processing, and another for the actual [CNN model training and testing](https://github.com/greenwoode/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/TF-CNN). Each branch has its own requirements that can be found in the readme.md for each.
