# Deep-Learning Specialization

## Accelerating Image Classification Models with Input Domain Restrictions

We aim to show that domain-restricted models can learn more valuable information during training, and subsequently out perform a general model. We trained two models, one on an ImageNet subset, and another on a custom dataset comprised of frames from video games.

This repository has two branches, one for the [data collecting](https://github.com/greenwoode/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/Data) and processing, and another for the actual [CNN model training and testing](https://github.com/greenwoode/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/TF-CNN). Each branch has its own requirements that can be found in the readme.md for each.
